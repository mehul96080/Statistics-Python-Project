Project Summary: Analyzing the Impact of Smoking on the Age of First Heart Attack
Project Overview
Sabrina was tasked with collecting random samples from male Healthy Life members in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) who were recently hospitalized due to heart attacks. Two distinct datasets were compiled:

Dataset 1: Male Toronto residents who smoke.
Dataset 2: Male Toronto residents who never smoked.
The goal of this research is to provide evidence on whether smoking is a risk factor for an earlier occurrence of the first heart attack.

Hypothesis Formulated
Sabrina hypothesized that, on average, male smokers experience their first heart attack six years earlier than male non-smokers.

Analysis Conducted
Sample Variance Calculation:

Calculated the sample variances for both the smoking and non-smoking groups.
Test Selection:

Based on the calculated sample variances, determined the appropriate t-test:
Data Analysis t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances or
Data Analysis t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances
Statistical Test:

Conducted the selected t-test at a 5% significance level to test the hypothesis.
Findings and Decision
Sample Variances: Calculated variances were compared to decide on the type of t-test.
Test Results: The t-test was performed to assess whether the average age of first heart attack differs significantly between male smokers and non-smokers.
Notes
Both samples are from normally distributed populations, so no histograms were required for this analysis.
